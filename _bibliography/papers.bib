  abs_only = {Retailers frequently face challenges in demand forecasting which can lead to excess inventory. This is often addressed through clearance sales where the inventory is sold at a markdown price. In these situations, the presence of competition can largely alter the optimal strategy for a retailer. This study proposes a two-period model that determines the optimal initial order quantity for a retailer in the presence of competition. Our model highlights how competition dynamics affect revenue, demonstrating significant gain over the traditional Newsvendor model in limited clearance scenarios. Furthermore, we extend the model to study the impact of risk aversion on these decisions.}

  abs_only = {Skip-Lagging is a practice where a strategic customer takes advantage of a situation where a connecting flight through an intermediate city is cheaper than a direct flight to the city. In such a case, the customer wishing to travel to an intermediate city will purchase a connecting flight through the city and deplane at the connection point. In this paper, we try to model the effect of skip-lagging behaviour on airline revenue under a single resource capacity control scenario. Our Dual Booking limit considers separate booking limits for the direct and connecting flight segments while determining the optimal seat allocation. We demonstrate that our model achieves a significant revenue increase compared to the traditional single booking limit model. Moreover, we show our model incentivizes customers to refrain from engaging in skip-lagging practices. We also analyze the solution space of the model to develop an efficient Integer Linear Programming formulation for the seat allocation problem. Furthermore, we extend the model to scenarios where multiple Skip-Lagging opportunities are present for strategic customers.}
