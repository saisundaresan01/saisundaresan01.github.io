I build practical, efficient ML systems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems. My current research focuses on reducing inference cost and latency in generative models by uncovering redundancies and enabling reuse of computation.

Recently, I have:

- Developed chunk-cache management for RAG-style LLM serving achieving ~2.7× prefill speedups while preserving quality.
- Built patch-level reuse for video generation via rectified flow interpolation (ongoing).
- Trained and deployed speech systems (ASR/TTS) and built a guided audio lesson generation pipeline.

Previously, I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Industrial and Systems Engineering at IIT Kharagpur (GPA 9.15/10), with a micro‑specialization in AI.

The site includes a curated list of publications, selected projects, patents, and a CV.
